Price Match

Your campus bookstores price match Booksmart, Barnes & Noble, and Amazon!

A few simple rules:

  * If you find a cheaper price after you bought one of our books, we’ll
    give you the difference on a gift card, but only within 7 days of
    the original transaction.
  * The price must come from another local bookstore or online retailer.
    No peer‐to‐peer marketplaces or aggregator sites.
  * The item must currently be in‐stock with us and the local competitor
    or online site that is being price matched. Digital books excluded.
  * The price advertised has to be for the exact book and edition in our
    store, including accompanying components like CDs, online access
    cards, student manuals and the like.
  * The competitor has to clearly state whether the book is new, used or
    rented.

If you find a better advertised deal on a textbook that we carry, bring
the ad into the bookstore and we’ll give you a discount for the difference.

BUY IT. RENT IT. NEW OR USED ‐ we’ll match the lowest advertised price.


Rent-a-Text Program

Rent-a-text is a lower cost option for obtaining the materials needed
for your classes! For more information about this program, contact the
